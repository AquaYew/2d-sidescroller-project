# 2d-sidescroller-project
This is my twist I made on a side scroller project from school.

that is the link to my p5 code.
The game is about collecting all of the money, while avoided obstacles such as the bomb. The gold bar will give you 100 dollars, and there are different endings based on how much money you made. (Theres an easter egg if you get 500 points)
